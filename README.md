# BarkBuddy AI: Translating Dog Barks into Emotions

**Building AI course project**

## Summary

BarkBuddy AI is a machine learning-powered app that analyzes a dog‚Äôs barks, whines, and growls to interpret their emotional state, helping owners better understand their pets. This project bridges the communication gap between dogs and their humans by identifying emotional cues in real-time.

**Building AI course project**

## Background

Many dog owners struggle to understand their pet's needs and emotions. While experienced owners may recognize certain sounds, new or less experienced owners often feel lost. Dogs primarily communicate through vocalizations and body language, and understanding these signals can improve their care and strengthen the bond between dogs and their owners.

### Key Problems:
- Misinterpretation of barks and vocalizations leads to unmet needs and frustration.
- New owners may not recognize signs of stress, excitement, or fear.
- Limited tools are available to decode a dog‚Äôs vocalizations.

This project aims to solve these problems by providing a tool that helps dog owners understand their pets better and respond to their emotional needs.

## How is it used?

### For Dog Owners:
1. Record your dog‚Äôs vocalizations (barks, whines, growls) using a smartphone.
2. The app processes the audio in real time and categorizes it into emotional states such as happiness, excitement, fear, or distress.
3. Receive recommendations or alerts based on the interpreted emotion, e.g., ‚ÄúYour dog might be anxious‚Äîcheck for triggers like loud noises.‚Äù

### Additional Features:
- **Audio History:** Monitor changes in emotional states over time to understand patterns.
- **Tips and Recommendations:** Practical advice for responding to specific emotions or situations.
- **Smart Collar Integration:** Continuous monitoring of vocalizations with wearable devices.

### Example Use Cases:
- Identify the reason behind a dog‚Äôs bark (e.g., hunger, needing to go outside, or seeing a stranger).
- Alert owners if their dog shows signs of distress when left alone.
- Help train new dog owners to respond effectively to their pet‚Äôs needs.

## Data Sources and AI Methods

### Data Sources:
- Audio recordings of dog vocalizations from:
  - Open datasets
  - Animal shelters
  - Veterinary behavior studies
- Annotated datasets linking vocalizations to emotions or situations (e.g., play, stress, or warnings).

### AI Techniques:
- **Audio Processing:** Extracting key features such as pitch, frequency, and duration from recordings.
- **Supervised Learning:** Training the model with labeled datasets to classify vocalizations into emotional states.
- **Sentiment Analysis Models:** Adapted specifically for non-human sounds to detect emotions.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Leveraging user feedback to refine and improve accuracy over time.

## Challenges

- Variability in vocalizations across breeds and individual dogs.
- Limited labeled data for certain rare emotional states or sounds.
- Differentiating background noise from relevant dog sounds.
- Ensuring user privacy and ethical handling of audio recorded in homes.

## What next?

- Collaborate with veterinarians and animal behaviorists to refine the AI model and validate predictions.
- Create a community-driven database where users can upload sounds to improve the system‚Äôs accuracy.
- Expand the app to:
  - Recognize body language through video input.
  - Integrate with wearable devices to monitor heart rate, movement, and stress levels for a holistic understanding of the dog‚Äôs state.

## Acknowledgments

- Inspired by advancements in animal behavior studies and existing audio processing tools.
- Based on open-source datasets and collaborations with dog training professionals.
- A big thank you to the open-source community for tools and resources to help bring this project to life.
