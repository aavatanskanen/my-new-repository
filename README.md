# BarkBuddy AI: Translating Dog Barks into Emotions

## Summary

BarkBuddy AI is a machine learning-powered app that analyzes a dog’s barks, whines, and growls to interpret their emotional state, helping owners better understand their pets. **Building AI course project.**

## Background

Many dog owners struggle to understand their pet's needs and emotions. While experienced owners can recognize certain sounds or behaviors, new owners or those with less experience often feel lost. Dogs primarily communicate through vocalizations and body language, and understanding these signals can improve their care and strengthen the bond between dogs and owners.

Misinterpretation of barks and vocalizations can lead to unmet needs or frustration for both the dog and owner. New owners may not recognize signs of stress, excitement, or fear, and limited tools are available to help decode a dog’s sounds. This project aims to bridge the communication gap between humans and dogs.

## How is it used?

Owners record their dog’s vocalizations using their smartphone. The app processes the audio in real time and categorizes it into emotional states like happiness, excitement, fear, or distress. The app provides recommendations or alerts based on the emotion, such as “Your dog might be anxious—check for triggers like loud noises.”

### Additional Features:

- **Audio History:** Monitor changes in the dog’s emotions over time to understand patterns.
- **Practical Tips:** Guidance for responding to specific emotions or situations.
- **Smart Collar Integration:** Continuous monitoring of vocalizations with wearable devices for added convenience.

### Example Use Cases:

- Identifying why a dog is barking (e.g., hunger, needing to go outside, or spotting a stranger).
- Alerting owners if their dog shows signs of distress when left alone.
- Training new dog owners to better understand and respond to their pet’s needs.

## Data Sources and AI Methods

### Data Sources:

- Audio recordings of dog vocalizations from open datasets, shelters, and veterinary behavior studies.
- Annotated datasets linking vocalizations to emotions or contexts (e.g., play, stress, or warnings).

### AI Techniques:

- **Audio Processing:** Extracting key features like pitch, frequency, and duration.
- **Supervised Learning:** Training the model with labeled datasets to classify vocalizations into emotional states.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Adapted specifically for non-human sounds to detect emotion.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Leveraging user feedback to refine and improve accuracy over time.

## Challenges

- Variability in vocalizations across breeds and individual dogs.
- Limited labeled data for certain rare emotional states or sounds.
- Ensuring user privacy and ethical handling of audio recorded in homes.
- Differentiating background noise from relevant dog sounds.
